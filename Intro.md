# Introduction
Perform Statistics for business analytics from an analysis-of-data viewpoint on Microsoft Excel. 
Topics include frequency distributions; measures of location; mean, median, mode; measures of dispersion; variance; graphic presentation; elementary probability; populations and samples; sampling distributions; categorical data; regression and correlation; and analysis of variance.
# Outcomes
1. Explore the use of statistical software in data analysis through hands-on applications.
2. Create distributions and graphical representation based on given data and identify which distribution models best fit the data.
3. Apply the theory of probability to calculate events’ likelihoods, understanding the differences between experimental and theoretical probabilities (the Law of Large Numbers), and calculate posterior probabilities by using the Bayes’ Law with emphasis on applications.
4. Perform estimations of population parameters using confidence intervals based on one sample and perform estimations of the difference between two population parameters of the same kind based on two samples.
5. Conduct regression and chi-squared test of independency to study associations between numerical and categorical variables respectively; and justify the legitimacy of the regression model.
6. Perform various hypothesis tests, including those for a population parameter (single sample), and the difference between two population parameters of the same kind (two samples), and perform analysis of variance (ANOVA).
7. Interpret meaningful relationships and patterns in the data in relation to a given business question.
8. Construct a sound business question, generate data to understand the business question and then detect meaningful relations and patterns in data to explore answers to the business question.
